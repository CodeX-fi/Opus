# Opus

Opus is an application for performing common tasks with pdf-files.

## Features

### Extraction

Easily extract bookmark ranges from one or more pdfs. Combine extracted page ranges into one document or save them as separate documents. Rearrange bookmarks before extraction to produce numbered outputs and use placeholders like bookmark name or filename for name templates.

### Signature removal

Conveniently remove digital signatures from hundreds of files at once, creating editable copies!

### Merging

Merge multiple pdf files into one with ease! Create bookmark trees with hierarchical structures from merged files.

### Document composition

Compose documents contained in a directory structure into a new document based on composition profiles and pre-defined sections - using the familiar syntax of Regex!
